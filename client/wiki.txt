        - Behaves like Lazada. Must be signed in to start ordering (LOL)
        - To add to cart in Lazada, you'll be prompted to login
            - For Debug purposes, assume "user1" is logged in 

System creates Cart (order_details)
    - Defaults are set
        - Total is 0
        - Cart contents can be empty

System creates cart contents
    - Can add contents
        - Content quantity can be Updated    
        - Can delete contents
            - If updated/deleted, cart total should be updated as well

On Checkout proper
    - Payment details amount is updated to final amount
    - Provider is set (PayMaya or whatever API I find)

- Using token, server POSTs a Payment
- Server pays, then status is returned
